# JavaScript vs Java

Totally independent programming languages with different syntax and principles

JavaScript was named JavaScript to 'sound cool'

Java does NOT run in Browser, JavaScript does

## Java

- Object-oriented
- strongly typed

## JavaScript

- Flexible
- weakly typed

## Client-side (Browser)

- The origin of JavaScript
- Different browser vendors provide their own JavaScript execution engines (e.g. v8)
- Allows interaction with web page and browser API (e.g. get user location)

## Server-side (Node.js)

- Why not use JavaScript outisde of the browser ? Allows for code & knowledge re-usage
- Extracted v8 engine to run JavaScript anywhere
- Special non-browser APIs (e.g. to work with file system, incoming HTTP requests etc.)

> Syntax, concepts, core features etc. are exactly the same in both environment!

## Why Browser-side first ?

- It's JavaScript's Origin
- No Alternatives to JavaScript to Browser
- Node.js uses the same Syntax
