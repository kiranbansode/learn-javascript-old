# JavaScript Executes In A Hosted Environment

## Browser-side

- JavaScript was invented to create more dynamic websites by executing in the browser!
- JavaScript can manipulate the HTML code, CSS, send background HTTP requests & much more
- JavaScript CAN'T access the local filesystem, interact with the operating system etc

## 'Other' (e.g. Server-Side)

- Google's JavaScript Engine (**v8**) was extracted to run JavaScript anywhere (called **"Node.js"**)
- Node.js can be executed on any machine and is therefore often used to build web backends (server-side JavaScript)
- Node.js CAN access the local filesystem, interact with the operating system etc. It CAN'T manipulate HTML or CSS
