# Dynamic vs Weakly Typed Languages

## Dynamic, Interpreted Programming Language

- Not pre-compiled, instead parsed and compiled 'on the fly' (e.g. in the browser)
- Code evaluated and executed at runtime
- Code can change at runtime (e.g. type of a variable)

## Weakly Typed Programming Language

- Data types are assumed (e.g. assigned to variables) automatically
- You don't define that some variable has to hold a certrain value (e.g. a number)
- Data types are not set in stone but can change
