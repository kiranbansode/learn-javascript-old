# js-evolution

## ES5 (and older)

- Support in basically all browser, including old IE.

- Only had `var` not `let` or `const`

- Generally same syntax as ES6, but quite some missing features

## ES6 (and newer) : Modern JavaScript

- Supported in modern browsers, can (mostly) be transpiled to ES5

- Many new features that help us write cleaner, better & faster code

- Still under active development, but ES6 was a big step forward
