# function-declaration-vs-expression

## Function Declaration / Function Statement

```js
function multiply(a, b) {
	return a * b;
}
```

Hoisted to top, can be declared anywhere in the file (i.e. also after it's used)

## Function Expression

```js
const multiply = function (a, b) {
	return a * b;
};
```

Hoisted to top but not initialized / defined, can't be declared anywhere in the file (i.e. not after it's used)
