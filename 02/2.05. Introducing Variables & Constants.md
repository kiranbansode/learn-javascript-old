# Introducing Variables & Constants

## Variables

A variable is a data container or data storage or an empty box where we will put some data.

```js
let userName = "Kiran";
```

`let` keyword will tell javascript engine to create a data container whose name will be `userName` and `=` will tell javascript engine to assign or put `Kiran` as data(value) in `userName` container.

Value(data) will mutable(can reassign or edit) or can change if it is created using `let` keyword.

## Constants

If a variable is created using constant then it's value(data) will be immutable(can't reassign or edit) or where the value must not change.

> Use constants as often as possible (i.e. whenever you actually got that data that never changes) to be clear about your intentions(in your code).
