# Introducing Functions

1. Define Function

```js
function greetUser(name) {
  alert("Hi " + name);
}
```

You can (but don't have to) use parameters (e.g. name) and you can (but don't have to) return value (via return)

2. Call Function

```js
greetUser("Max");
```

As often as you want, passing in (different) parameter values!

Every function execution then runs independent from (possible) other execution.
