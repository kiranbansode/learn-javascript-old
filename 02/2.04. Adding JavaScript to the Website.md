# Ways to Import JavaScript

1. Inside Head tag using `<script></script>` tag. As script increases it will be very hard to maintain as it becomes very big file.

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script>
    alert("Not Recommended!!!");
  </script>
</head>
```

2. Addind `src` attribute to `<script></script>` tag and giving path to javascript file, all inside the head tag.

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="/assets/scripts/app.js"></script>
</head>
```

3. Same as 2nd but inside `<body></body>` tag, not inside head tag and at before end tag of body. This will stop javascript from blocking HTML rendering.

```html
<body>
  ...
  <script src="/assets/scripts/app.js"></script>
</body>
```
