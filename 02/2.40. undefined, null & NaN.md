# undefined, null & NaN

## Special Values

- `undefined`

Default Value of uninitialized variables

You shouldn't assign `undefined` as a value manually

- `null`

Never assumed by default

You can assign this is a value if you want to 'reset' / 'clear' a variable

- `NaN`

Technically, it's of type number and can therefore be used in calculations

It yields a new `NaN` and it's the result of invalid calculations (e.g. 3 \* 'hi')
